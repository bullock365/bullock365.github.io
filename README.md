# About Me  
## My Interest 
  I am deeply interested in the field of cybersecurity, and I’m currently pursuing a degree in this area. My passion lies in protecting digital infrastructure and solving complex security challenges. I am excited by the constant evolution of the field, particularly with the rise of new technologies and the ever-growing need for robust defense systems. I envision myself continuing my education with a Master's degree and potentially a PhD, as I am eager to deepen my expertise and contribute to research and innovation in the field.In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a strong creative side, which I express through sewing and making clothes from scratch. I enjoy challenging myself to create unique pieces that reflect my style.Im also into a lot of differnt fashions as well, which lead me to become a shoe collector and enjoy all types of uniqe products.On top of my academic and creative interests, I am also interested in becoming a notary public as a potential side job. This would allow me to gain experience in legal documentation and expand my professional skills, all while providing a valuable service to my community.Together, these diverse interests—cybersecurity, sewing, and exploring opportunities in notary work—help me develop a broad skill set that I believe will serve me well in both my career and personal life. I strive for a balanced approach, combining technical expertise with creative thinking and a desire to serve others.
